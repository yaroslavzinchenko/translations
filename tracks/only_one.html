	<div class="string-container">I guess I'll be the first to say it:</div>
	<div class="string-container">I haven't felt this good in a while</div>
	<div class="string-container">You tell me I'm the only one that they would all like</div>
	<div class="string-container">But you're the only one that kept me alive</div>
</p>

<p>
	<div class="string-container">You were the only one</div>
	<div class="string-container">You were the only one that kept me alive</div>
	<div class="string-container">You were the only one, the only one that was on my side</div>
	<div class="string-container">You were the only one that kept me alive</div>

	<div class="string-container">Even after all this time</div>
	<div class="string-container">Fear can grip me at night</div>
	<div class="string-container">But somehow, somewhere you make me believe</div>
	<div class="string-container">I could see it in your eyes</div>
	<div class="string-container">So take me as your breathing proof</div>
	<div class="string-container">For everything you've ever done for me</div>
	<div class="string-container">I won't lie and fear no more</div>
	<div class="string-container">I hope you realize:</div>
	<div class="string-container">You kept me alive</div>

	<div class="string-container">You were the only one that kept me alive</div>
	<div class="string-container">You were the only one, the only one that was on my side</div>
	<div class="string-container">You were the only one that kept me alive</div>
</p>

<p>
	<div class="string-container">You saw my insides from the outside</div>
	<div class="string-container">You saw a chance, gave me truth so I survived</div>
	<div class="string-container">Saw my insides from the outside</div>
	<div class="string-container">You saw my insides from the outside</div>
	<div class="string-container">You took a chance, gave me proof without a goodbye</div>
	<div class="string-container">Now here I am, just happy to be alive</div>
</p>

<p>
	<div class="string-container">You were the only one</div>
